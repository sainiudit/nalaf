          <p id="s2p1">The ATF7 proteins, which are members of the cyclic AMP responsive binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family of transcription factors, display quite versatile properties: they can interact with the adenovirus E1a oncoprotein, mediating part of its transcriptional activity; they heterodimerize with the Jun, Fos or related transcription factors, likely modulating their DNA-binding specificity; they also recruit to the promoter a stress-induced protein kinase (JNK2). In the present study, we investigate the functional relationships of ATF7 with hsTAF12 (formerly hsTAF(II)20/15), which has originally been identified as a component of the general transcription factor TFIID. We show that overexpression of hsTAF12 potentiates ATF7-induced transcriptional activation through direct interaction with ATF7, suggesting that TAF12 is a functional partner of ATF7. In support of this conclusion, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirm the interaction of ATF7 with TAF12 on an ATF7-responsive promoter, in the absence of any artificial overexpression of both proteins. We also show that the TAF12-dependent transcriptional activation is competitively inhibited by TAF4. Although both TAF12 isoforms (TAF12-1 and -2, formerly TAF(II)20 and TAF(II)15) interact with the ATF7 activation region through their histone-fold domain, only the largest, hsTAF12-1, mediates transcriptional activation through its N-terminal region.</p>
